# TSC Governance

Operating procedures, conflict of interest disclosures, and 
decision records for the Technical Steering Committee.

## Contents

### Operating Procedures
- TSC charter and scope
- Decision-making process
- Meeting cadence and scheduling
- Organizer roles and responsibilities

### Conflict of Interest Register
All TSC members, organizers, and contracted maintainers are 
expected to disclose financial, employment, or ownership 
relationships with organizations that develop, sell, or maintain 
products subject to conformance testing or certification. 
Disclosures are maintained publicly in this repository.

### Decision Records
Significant decisions are documented with rationale and 
recorded vote where applicable, ensuring a permanent public 
record of how and why the TSC reached its conclusions.

## Principles

- **Non-hierarchical**: All TSC members participate on equal 
  footing with equal voice
- **Transparent**: Decisions and rationale are public
- **Accountable**: Conflicts of interest are disclosed, 
  not hidden

## Heritage Acknowledgment

the Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) Initiative, a program of 
the U.S. Department of Defense, funded by the American taxpayer.
